## CedarJavaFFI
Bindings to allow calling the core Cedar functions (`is_authorized` and `validate`) from Java.

## Usage

### Build
You can build the code with
```shell
cargo build
```

### Run
You can test the code with

Typically you will want to use `../CedarJava` in your project and won't care about `CedarJavaFFI`.
