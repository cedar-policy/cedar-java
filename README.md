## Cedar Java

This repository contains `CedarJavaFFI`, a Rust crate to allow calling the Cedar library from Java and `CedarJava`, a Java package to make calling Cedar from Java more convenient.

You can find build instructions and more information in the subfolders.

## Note
You need JDK 17 or later to run the Java code.

Cedar is primarily developed in Rust. CedarJava typically lags behind the newest Cedar features. Notably, as of this writing, Cedar Java does not expose Partial Evaluation APIs.
