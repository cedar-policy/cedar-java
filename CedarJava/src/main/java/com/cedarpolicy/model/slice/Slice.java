 * A Slice is a set of policies, entities; in essence, it is the part of the Cedar database that is
 * needed to answer a particular request. A slice is provided to the authorization engine to evaluate
 * a request. The creation of a slice is very important, if the slice leaves out a relevant policy,
 * the authorization engine may return an incorrect answer. The safe, easy choice is to have a slice
 * always contain every policy and entity.
