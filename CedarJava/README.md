## CedarJava

This package provides the Java interface for the Cedar language. You can use these to call Cedar from your Java applications. See [java-hello-world](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-examples/tree/main/cedar-java-hello-world) for an example of calling Cedar from a Java application.

For more information about Cedar, please see: https://www.cedarpolicy.com/

## Usage
This package depends on [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/), a library
that needs to be compiled so that it can be run on the used platform.
You need JDK 17 or later to run the code.

You need to ensure the `CEDAR_JAVA_FFI_LIB` variable is set correctly. Typically running `config.sh` will set this for you.

### Building
- Ensure Rust, Gradle and a JDK are installed.
- clone `cedar-policy/cedar` into `cedar-java/cedar` (you don't have to build it)
- then:
```shell
cd CedarJavaFFI
cargo build
cargo test
cd ../CedarJava
bash config.sh
./gradlew build
```

This will run the tests as well.

## Debugging

If you're encountering unexpected errors, a good first step in debugging can be to enable TRACE-level logging for
`cedarpolicy`, which will then show the exact messages being passed to Cedar. You can do this for
the unit tests by modifying the `test/resources/log4j2.xml` file; this file also gives an example for what to do in
other Log4j2-based packages.

Debugging calls across the JNI boundary is a bit tricky (as ever a bit more so on a Mac), but can be done by attaching
both a Java and native debugger (such as GDB/LLDB) to the program.

## Unsupported Features
You can see a list of features not yet supported in CedarJava at [Differences from Rust](DIFFERENCES_FROM_RUST.md).
